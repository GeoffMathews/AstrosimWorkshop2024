    <h1> Using Astronomy Education Simulations </h1>

<p>In recent years, hundreds of browser-based astronomy-related simulations have been made publicly available by dozens of groups and individuals.  Their broad accessibility supports many modes of educational use, such as integration with pre-class preparations, in-class use as a demonstration and visualization tool, or use by students for model comparisons or simulated data collection.  </p>

<p>In this 50-minute participatory workshop, I will provide a broad overview of the space of astronomy education simulations, discuss three use cases and complementary materials (such as accompanying instructions or graphics), and provide time and discussion space for participants to outline their own use cases and prepare a plan for using an astro-education sim in their upcoming teaching.  </p>

<p>Below is a curated selection of browser-based astronomy education simulations, a recommended "starter-set" for astronomy instructors.  A more complete - and barely organized - listing of extant simulations is available at the <a href="https://foothill.edu/astronomy/astrosims.html">Foothill College Astrosims</a> (<a href="https://https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UN2LIh8TIoAYmp20fA9wYNC4XeJsuFte7fp4hPGfrMI/edit?usp=sharing"">direct link</a>). </p>
