    <h1> Using Astronomy Education Simulations </h1>

<p>In recent years, hundreds of browser-based astronomy-related simulations have been made publicly available by dozens of groups and individuals.  Their broad accessibility supports many modes of educational use, such as integration with pre-class preparations, in-class use as a demonstration and visualization tool, or use by students for model comparisons or simulated data collection.  </p>

<p>In this 50-minute participatory workshop, I will provide a broad overview of the space of astronomy education simulations, discuss three use cases and complementary materials (such as accompanying instructions or graphics), and provide time and discussion space for participants to outline their own use cases and prepare a plan for using an astro-education sim in their upcoming teaching.  </p>

<p>Below is a curated selection of browser-based astronomy education simulations, a recommended "starter-set" for astronomy instructors.  A more complete listing of extant simulations is available at <a href="https://foothill.edu/astronomy/astrosims.html">Foothill College Astrosims</a> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UN2LIh8TIoAYmp20fA9wYNC4XeJsuFte7fp4hPGfrMI/edit?usp=sharing"">direct link</a>). </p> 
    

    <h2> embedding in pre-class preparation </h2>

These are narrowly focused simulations that place a premium on ease-of-use, and demonstrating a connection between one or more dependent and independent variables.  They have also been formatted with ease of use in mind, with a design oriented to embedding within the flow of text on a site within a learning-management system such as Canvas.  <br>
