    <h1> Using Astronomy Education Simulations </h1>

<p>In recent years, hundreds of browser-based astronomy-related simulations have been made publicly available by dozens of groups and individuals.  Their broad accessibility supports many modes of educational use, such as integration with pre-class preparations, in-class use as a demonstration and visualization tool, or use by students for model comparisons or simulated data collection.  </p>

<p>In this 50-minute participatory workshop, I will provide a broad overview of the space of astronomy education simulations, discuss three use cases and complementary materials (such as accompanying instructions or graphics), and provide time and discussion space for participants to outline their own use cases and prepare a plan for using an astro-education sim in their upcoming teaching.  </p>

<p>Below is a curated selection of browser-based astronomy education simulations, a recommended "starter-set" for astronomy instructors.  A more complete listing of extant simulations is available at <a href="https://foothill.edu/astronomy/astrosims.html">Foothill College Astrosims</a> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UN2LIh8TIoAYmp20fA9wYNC4XeJsuFte7fp4hPGfrMI/edit?usp=sharing">direct link</a>). </p> 
    

    <h2> embedding in pre-class preparation </h2>

<p>The examples we have selected are narrowly focused simulations that place a premium on ease-of-use and demonstrating connections between a small number of concepts.  They have designs suitable to embedding within the flow of text, images, and videos on a site within a learning-management system such as Canvas. </p>

<ul>
  <li>  <a href="https://foothillastrosims.github.io/stellar-lifespan/" target="_blank">Stellar Lifespan Simulator</a> allows students to explore how stellar mass and luminosity affect main-sequence lifespan, and to see their fictional or realistic star play out its simplified lifespan next to the sun.  (Foothill College AstroSims) </li>
    <li>  <a href="https://sciencesims.com/sims/star-color-blackbody/" target="_blank">Star Color and Blackbody curve tool</a>  provides a simultaneous comparison of the thermal continuum and the by-eye color appearance of a star as the temperature varies, with an explicit highlight of the peak wavelength. (CCNY Science Sims)  </li> 
  <li>  <a href="https://astro.unl.edu/mobile/lookback-time-simulator/index.html" target="_blank">Lookback Time Simulator</a> supports student exploration of the time delay between events happening and us receiving the light from them.  (U. Nebraska - Lincoln's Astronomy Education in partnership with Columbia University's Center for Teaching and Learning)   </li> 
</ul>

    <h2> in-class demonstration and visualization </h2>

<p>The examples we highlight here clearly illustrate their central concepts, but have enough relevant and interrelated variables that students may not be able to utilize them independently prior to instruction.  They can be used as a centerpiece for direct instruction, guided discussion with the class, or transition into student work.</p>

  <li>  <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/gravity-and-orbits/latest/gravity-and-orbits_all.html" target="_blank"> Gravity and Orbits</a> supports extensive discussion of one of the most fundamental rules of the universe: stronger gravity requires faster motion to the side. (PHET)   </li> 
  <li>  <a href="https://applets.kcvs.ca/BuildAPlanet/buildAPlanet.html" target="_blank"> Build a Planet</a> supports teaching of how energy balance of insolation, albedo, and greenhouse effect determine the surface temperature of a world. (King's Centre for Visualization in Science)   </li> 
  <li>  <a href="https://foothillastrosims.github.io/cosmological-redshift/" target="_blank">Cosmological Redshift</a> simulator supports walking through the stretching of space that occurs while light travels to us from distant objects, and the effect this stretching has upon the wavelength of the light.

</ul>

    <h2> student use for comparing models and data, or simulated data collection </h2>
      
      <p>The examples we highlight here are built to provide students quantitative model results that can be compared to in-application data or data from external sources.</p>

    <li>  <a href="http://astro.sbaldridge.com/kepler/" target="_blank">Jupiter's Large Moons</a> tool supports students in simulating observations of Jupiter's four large moons, to then use in calculating Jupiter's mass. (Sean Baldridge, Williams Woods U.)  </li> 
  <li>  <a href="https://foothillastrosims.github.io/gravitational-lensing/" target="_blank">Gravitational Lensing </a> simulator allows students to use measured offset angles and known distances to calculate the mass of galaxy clusters. (Foothill College AstroSims)   </li>
